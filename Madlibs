# String concatenation (join strings together)
# Suppose we want to create a string that says "subscribe to _____(eg my_channel) "
# my_channel = "some string variable"

# Few ways to do this are given below:
# print("subscribe to " + my_channel)
# print("subscribe to {}".format(my_channel))
# print(f"subscribe to {my_channel}")

# Just an example:
# Need to get input for all vales that we need user to input
adj = input("Input an Adjective: ")
verb1 = input("Input a Verb: ")
verb2 = input("Input a Verb: ")
famous_person = input("Input a Famous person: ")

# You can write any story or paragraph as you wish
madlib = f"Programming is so {adj}! Programming makes me so excited all the time because \
I like to {verb1}. Stay {verb2} like you are {famous_person}!"

# Just need to print the final story
print(madlib)
